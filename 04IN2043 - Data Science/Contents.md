04IN2043-1 - Data Science
Data Science describes a set of methods for handling data-intensive problems. The topic connects several disciplines such as physics, biology, social sciences and economics. It uses elaborate computer science paradigms and needs a background in statistics.

More specifically the lecture will cover the topics:

Topics:

Data science: history and background, change of paradigm from statistics to programming
Problem scenarios will mostly deal with open data, such as found on the Web and open statistical data
Background in statistics
Details of computing statistics and determining the quality of a probabilistic model. In particular, we will look at distributions commonly used for modeling:
Uniform distribution
Normal distribution
Exponential distribution
Power law distribution
Poisson distribution
Log normal distribution
And we will look at quality measures such as:
Students' t-test (valid only for normal distributions)
Chi square
ANOVA
Kulback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon
Kolmogorov-Smirnovv
Hypothesis driven research
Hypothesis testing
Statistics fallacies
Applications
Programming paradigms
Relational and NoSQL Database Management Systems
Parallel task processing: Gridgain
MapReduce (Hadoop/Spark)
Graph Paradigms (GraphLab, neo4j, RDF Databases)
Visualization
Simple machine learning on large scale data
Example application domain: text
n-grams
p-grams
generalized n-grams (gappy n-grams)

Die Inhalte der Vorlesung werden vertiefend geübt.

Die Studierenden lösen Data Science Aufgaben zum Teil mit Stift und Papier und zum Teil programmatisch.
